# MyThesis-
This work is about the building process and the functionality of a haptic mechanism with 2 degrees of freedom. The purpose of this work is to better understand these mechanisms, through the building process of one, to enable users to perform basic functions through it.
The key points of the project are:
•	a requirement analysis of the theoretical background
•	evaluation of the equipment and hardware needs 
•	design of the 3d models needed to be printed for the assembly
•	the construction and assembly of a functional prototype
•	creating a piece of software in python to access the readings of the hardware to ensure the correct functionality of the assembly
